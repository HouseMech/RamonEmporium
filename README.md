# RamonEmporium
This is a repository to house Ramon-based products from his COSC304 and COSC404 classes. Should you desire to look at or use Ramon-based materials, look no further.

## Disclaimer
This is in no way meant as an attack towards Professor Lawrence or anyone else who may be depicted in these photographs. We all love and appreciate the man and the classes he teaches. Should the Professor somehow stumble upon this repository, I offer my sincerest apologies and I only ask not to be sued for defamation.
